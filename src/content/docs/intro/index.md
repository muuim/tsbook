description: Learn how to read, understand, and fix common TypeScript error messages efficiently
---

This handbook is a **practical guide to understanding and fixing TypeScript error messages as quickly as possible**.

Have you ever thought:

* “I see the error message, but I don’t know what’s actually wrong.”
* “I Googled it, but none of the answers quite match my situation.”

This guide is designed to help you move forward **without guessing**, and to build the confidence to debug TypeScript errors on your own.

## What You’ll Learn from This Handbook

With this handbook, you can:

* Understand common TypeScript error messages and what they really mean
* Learn the most frequent root causes behind each error
* See minimal, focused examples that reproduce the problem
* Apply practical fixes that work in real projects
* Recognize patterns so similar errors become easier over time

Each page focuses on **one error**, keeping explanations short, concrete, and beginner-friendly.

---

## Who This Is For

This handbook is especially useful if you:

* Are new to TypeScript (Of course, those who want to know about errors too)
* Recently enabled `strict` or `strictNullChecks`
* Can read basic TypeScript but struggle to interpret compiler errors
* Want a quick reference instead of long blog posts

No advanced type-level programming knowledge is required.

## How to Use This Handbook

You can read this handbook in two ways:

### 1. Search by Error Message or Code

If you see an error like:

```
TS2339: Property 'x' does not exist on type 'Y'
```

Search for the error message or the error code (e.g. `TS2339`).
Each page explains:

* Why the error happens
* What TypeScript is trying to protect you from
* Multiple ways to fix it, with trade-offs

### 2. Browse by Category

Errors are grouped by categories such as:

* Type errors
* Null / undefined errors
* Function and argument errors
* Module and import errors

Browsing by category helps you spot recurring patterns in your mistakes.

---

## TypeScript Versions

Examples in this handbook target **TypeScript 5.x**.

Error messages may vary slightly between versions, but the underlying concepts remain the same.

## A Note on Learning TypeScript

TypeScript errors are not just obstacles — they’re hints.

Each error message reflects a mismatch between what your code *promises* and what it *actually does*.
Once you learn to read them calmly, TypeScript becomes less of an enemy and more of a safety net.
