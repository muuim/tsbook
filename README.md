# TSBook

This handbook is a **practical guide to understanding and fixing TypeScript error messages as quickly as possible**.

Have you ever thought:

* “I see the error message, but I don’t know what’s actually wrong.”
* “I Googled it, but none of the answers quite match my situation.”

This guide is designed to help you move forward **without guessing**, and to build the confidence to debug TypeScript errors on your own.
